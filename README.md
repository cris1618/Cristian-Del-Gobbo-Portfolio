## Projects
### Project 1: NanoGPT (Python)
**Description:**
In this project, I trained a decoder-only transformer model following the principles outlined in the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. The goal was to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on Shakespearean language.

To enhance the precision of the model, I utilized the TikToken encoding method instead of traditional single-character encoding. This approach allowed for a more granular and meaningful representation of the text, improving the overall quality of the generated content.

**Key Features:**
- Implemented a transformer architecture focusing solely on the decoder mechanism for text generation.
- Leveraged TikToken for more precise tokenization and encoding, improving model accuracy.
- Utilized PyTorch for model development, training, and evaluation.
- Optimized hyperparameters to ensure efficient training on a CPU-based environment.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- PyTorch
- TikToken
- Transformer Model (Decoder-Only)
- Shakespeare Text Dataset

**Project Outcomes:**
-Successfully trained a language model capable of generating Shakespeare-like text.
-Demonstrated the effectiveness of transformer models for natural language processing tasks.
-Showcased the benefits of using advanced tokenization techniques for improving model precision.

**Learnings:**
-Gained deep insights into the implementation of transformer models.
-Enhanced understanding of tokenization methods and their impact on model performance.
-Improved skills in optimizing machine learning models for resource-constrained environments.

### Project 4: InsightVisualizer (Python)
**Description:**
In this project, I explore the correlations between various socio-economic indicators such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and happiness score across different countries using two distinct datasets: "Life expectancy.csv" and "Suicide Rate.csv". Through meticulous analysis, these datasets are merged to construct a unified view of global socio-economic dynamics, uncovering underlying patterns and correlations.

While the project does not draw definitive conclusions due to potential inaccuracies in certain data columns, it leverages visualizations, custom functions, and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights. Strong correlations are observed between life expectancy, GDP per capita, and happiness score, indicating significant associations among these factors. However, minimal to no discernible relationship is found between other variables and suicide rate, possibly influenced by the nature of the data.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
- Python: Core programming language for development.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- SciPy: For advanced statistical computations.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
- XGBoost: For gradient boosting machine learning models.
- Random Forest Regressor: For ensemble learning methods.
  
**Key Insights and Outcomes:**
- Data Merging and Cleaning: Combined two datasets to create a comprehensive view of socio-economic factors.
- Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations: Generated detailed statistics and visualizations to understand data distributions and identify outliers.
- Correlation Analysis: Discovered strong correlations between life expectancy, GDP per capita, and happiness score, and minimal correlations involving suicide rates.
- Machine Learning Models: Developed models to predict life expectancy, GDP per capita, and happiness score, achieving promising performance metrics despite the limited data.
- Feature Importance Analysis: Identified key features impacting the prediction models, highlighting the significance of happiness score, fertility rate, and GDP per capita in influencing life expectancy and happiness.
